# ReadIt

A Reddit/Digg 'clone' in React Native.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Installing dependencies

`yarn` or `npm i`

Requires watchman.

Run `brew update` followed by `brew install watchman`.

## Scripts

#### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Run the app in development mode. Open the app in [Expo app](https://expo.io)
on your phone to view it.

#### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on the tests.

#### `yarn ios` or `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open the app in the iOS Simulator if
you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `yarn android` or `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open the app on a connected Android
device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools
(see [React Native docs]
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for
detailed setup).
